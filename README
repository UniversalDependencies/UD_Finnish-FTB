* Origin

The UD version of FinnTreeBank 1 was derived from FinnTreeBank 1 2014
by a scripted mapping of labels and some restructuring in an attempt
to conform approximately to the UD Finnish model.

Unannotated linguistic material in FinnTreeBank 1 2014 was adapted
from the examples in Ison suomen kieliopin verkkoversio (The Web
Version of the Large Grammar of Finnish, VISK), available on-line as
<http://scripta.kotus.fi/visk>, and annotations originally produced
and further revised in FIN-CLARIN projects in the Department of Modern
Languages, University of Helsinki.


* Differences from the UD Finnish model

Some differences from the UD Finnish model remain unaddressed.

Surface words that have an adverb or a conjunction fused with a
following negative verb are separated into two tokens in the
FinnTreeBank model. The UD version keeps them as such but adds the
unannotated joined token before the two.

A small number of multiword sequences remain as single tokens.

Most punctuation tokens are linked to a nearby token instead of a
clause head.

The xcomp relation is not used in the mapping (the distinction between
xcomp and comp is not supported in the underlying FinnTreeBank model).

As a catchall, the dep relation is used as intended when a more proper
mapping could not be determined.

Some FinnTreeBank annotations are retained in the MISC field.


* Splitting

The treebank was split into training, development, and test sets by
repeatedly taking 8 sentences into training set, 1 into development
set, and 1 into test set.
